                                My name is Morgan Murphy and I am currently attending University of Virginia. I am from New York City and have lived there my entire life. 
                                I have an older sister who just graduated from UVA, a twin sister who is at UVA with me, and a younger brother who is still in high school.
                                I am a media studies major and math minor but have enjoyed taking computer science classes, so I am excited for the next few weeks.
                            </p>

                                I love sailing and being on the water, as well as hiking. I also love to run and ran my first marathon in March. I am looking forward to running a 
                                half marathon in September! I was involved withHabitat for Humanity in high school and have continued to volunteer at UVA, as well as being a member 
                                of other clubs at UVA. I am an outgoing person so I like to be with other people in my free time and doing fun activities with my friends or just 
                                hanging out in my apartment with people. 
                            <p>   
                                I have never been to Cape Town so I am excited to explore the city, try different restaurants, hike Table Mountain 
                                and get to know my way around a new city. I studied abroad my sophomore year of high school in Madrid, Spain so I am excited to be studying abroad
                                again, even though it is only 6 weeks.
